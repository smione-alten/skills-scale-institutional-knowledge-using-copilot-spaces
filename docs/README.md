# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

OctoAcme runs projects with an emphasis on iterative delivery, clear ownership, and measurable outcomes. Projects begin with a lightweight Project One-pager to confirm the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline. Planning breaks work into shippable increments, captures dependencies and risks, and establishes a Definition of Done and release plan.

Day-to-day execution uses a simple project board workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined pull request process: small PRs linked to issues with acceptance criteria, automated CI checks, and required reviews before merging. Team rhythm includes daily standups, a weekly delivery sync, and demos at the end of sprints or milestones. Planning emphasizes prioritized backlogs, estimates, and clear acceptance criteria.

Roles and responsibilities are spelled out so accountabilities are clear: Product Managers (PdM) own outcomes and metrics, Project Managers (PM) coordinate schedules and communication, Developers implement features and tests, and QA validates acceptance criteria. Core artifacts include the Project One-pager, backlog, release plan, acceptance criteria, and a Risk Register.

Quality assurance and release discipline are enforced via CI (unit, integration, and security scans), smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA where needed. Releases follow type-specific checklists, require passing CI and pre-release checks, a rollback plan, and post-deploy verification. For details, see the linked process documents below.
